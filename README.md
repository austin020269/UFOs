## Analysis and Workflow
Running the app.js (https://github.com/austin020269/UFOs/blob/main/static/js/app.js) file yielded an index.html (https://github.com/austin020269/UFOs/blob/main/index.html) with a final webpage as shown below.

## Summary

The web page is good for showing events that have occurred in the US as well as seeing their locations and dates. The duration, shape and comments sections are also useful in detailing the nature of the event.  The drawback from the website is in its functionalty as it only references a file that has to be updated and not linked to database so events are more regularly updated as they occur in real time.

Two features I might add to this webpage would not only implement functionality as discussed above but to add a search engine to better find a location or certain type of event (shape, duration, comments etc.) for quicker use.
